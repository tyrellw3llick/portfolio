## What's a graph?

A graph is a way of modelling a set of connections.

Yes, that explanation was not for dummies. Let's try again!

Imagine you want to map the relationship between you and your friends. You could
draw a graph where each person represents a node, and each relationship represents
an edge.

In this graph relations between nodes are expressed by double-headed arrows called edges.
This can vary depending on the graph you are working with.

You know $[Bob, Alice, Anna]$
